# Heart-Disease-Classification
predicting from patient's medical records if a patient has heart disease or not.

Predicting heart disease using machine learning.

this notebook looks unto various python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

we are going to take the foolowing approach:

problem definition

data

evaluation

features

modelling

experimentation

1. problem Definition
   
in a statement given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease

3. Data

you can check UCI machine learning Repository or Kaggle for the heart disease data that will be used

4. Evaluation

if we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease or not during the proof of concept, we will pursue the proect.

5. Features

this is where you will get different information about each of the features in your data ** create data dictionary** (tells you about the data youre working on)
